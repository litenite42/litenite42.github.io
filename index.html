			    <li>
				    <h3>.NET/Azure</h3>
					As part of our standard toolchain, the city of Columbus utilizes a wide range of Azure Technologies to implement business processes throughout the various departments and organizations. ASP.NET Core was at the heart of this work as we have continued to develop our own tools to standardize and expediate our workflow while maintaining user experience.

					<details>
						<summary>More</summary>
						<ul>
							<li>Created and maintained an ASP.NET Core Template for all Web Team members to initiate new projects off of</li>
							<li>Identified and created RCLs to reduce redundant development of common tasks like frequently-used form components. </li>
							<li>Utilized Azure DevOps' Pipelines and Artifacts for releasing these RCLs for use and publishing Applications to specified deployment slots. </li>
						</ul>
					</details>
			    </li> 
			    <li>
				<h3>Evoq/DNN</h3>
				Most sites within the city are built with Evoq CMS. This allows us to quicklly build custom themes, modules, and Liquid Content to permit authorized users
				to control their site's content after deployments. 
			    </li>
			    <li>
				    <h3>Remote Work</h3>
				    Having worked multiple years from home while supervising multiple remote reports, with only routine in-person department meetings, I am fully confident in my ability to provide satisfactory work regardless of locale. My work with the V community and as an admin for the game SkillWarz also aid me in managing myself and my team in the proper manner.

An experiment to reverse engineer the leaderboard of an online multiplayer game that I was an admin for at the time. By mimicking the HTTP requests the forum used, players were able to search the scores from within the Community Discord. This was my first time publishing and supporting an application on my own and was quite the experience.
